## Objectives

### First Objective 
The Goal here is to successfully run the suite of tests in the /tests folder using the pytest library 

All of the tests right now will fail.  And you have to figure out why, and fix the issues so they all pass.

### Second Objective 

After the tests pass, given the current project convention of creating classes and testing those classes.

I want you to create your own class in the /classes folder and write your own test file for the class in the /tests folder.

These can be as basic as you want them to be.  I just want to know you know how to make classes and test those classes.

## Project Setup

1. Create python venv for the project
```bash
python -m venv venv
## OR
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the venv you just created
```bash
# Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Run the pytest command to start
```bash
pytest
```
